# redditbot
A reddit bot, made in python, that monitors a subreddit.

The bot can be summoned by a configurable keyword, and responds to commands, via replies or private messages.
I am not sure what it will reply when summoned, but it will problaby will be something /r/DotA2 related.

Edit the reddit.ini file to set the user the bot will use.
